This was created for the activity round of the Software Developer co-op position at GoFleet.

Two imgages under the src folder (GoFleet List/Map Display) show the display of the map and list view when running ng serve.

Main things that can be improved on (or added at a later time):
    -adding markers for the maps display to show task addresses (or even dummy addresses)
    -polishing out the buttons
    -adding colors and borders for the statuses in list view
    -adding the magnifying glass to the search field
    -perhaps making the data responsive to the input of the search and status field

Also note that ng build --prod will not work on the CLI as that command was depreciated, ng build --configuration production will build the product version.
